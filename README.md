# Would You Rather Project

This repository contains my implementation of the 'Would You Rather' web app.
This is the final assessment project for the Udacity's React & Redux course (part of the React Nanodegree Program).
The aim of the project was to practice React and Redux, in order to:

- improve the predictability of an application’s state
- establish strict rules for getting, listening, and updating the store
- identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components

# Project Overview & Requirements

In the "Would You Rather?" Project, you'll build a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In your app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

The user will be able to answer the question and upon answering will be able to see the polling results.

## Starter Code

The starter code will consist of a \_DATA.js file, which represents a fake database and contains methods that let you access the data.

Using the provided starter code, you will build a React/Redux front end for the application.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`
